# Insurance-Charges-Prediction-Project

# Overview
This GitHub repository contains an R project for analyzing and predicting insurance charges based on various features such as age, BMI, and the number of children. The project includes data exploration, visualization, linear regression modeling, and model evaluation.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project, "insurance.csv," includes information about insurance charges billed by health insurance for individuals. The dataset contains the following columns:

age: Age of the primary beneficiary.
sex: Gender of the insurance contractor (female, male).
bmi: Body mass index, a measure of body weight relative to height.
children: Number of children covered by health insurance.
smoker: Smoking status.
region: Residential area of the beneficiary in the US.
charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.
# Project Structure
01_data_exploration.R: Code for loading the dataset and exploring its structure.
02_data_visualization.R: Code for visualizing relationships between numerical variables.
03_linear_regression.R: Code for building a linear regression model to predict charges based on age, BMI, and children.
04_model_evaluation.R: Code for evaluating the performance of the linear regression model.
3 Usage
To run the project:

Download the "insurance.csv" dataset and place it in the project directory.
Execute the R scripts in numerical order (01_data_exploration.R, 02_data_visualization.R, 03_linear_regression.R, 04_model_evaluation.R).
# Results
The project provides insights into the relationships between key features and insurance charges. The linear regression model predicts charges, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the project for your specific analysis needs.
